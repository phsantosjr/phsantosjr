#### Profile

My name is Paulo, Iâ€™m from Brazil, and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over sixteen years of experience. 
My passion is to solve problems using the knowledge that Iâ€™ve had in my career. Iâ€™ve been working as a Software Engineer since 2014, before that I was a Database Developer, and my main tech stack are Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Docker, Distributed Computer with Celery, and AWS. 
I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and a MBA. In the last eight years Iâ€™ve been working in my own company, where I am responsible for IT, and we are doing a good job, having positive feedback and growing every year. 
In my free time, I enjoy reading books, playing with my daughter, travelling, and spending time with my family. An interesting thing about me is that I love coffee, and indeed I developed a platform to help people like me to find Brazilianâ€™s Special Coffee.
